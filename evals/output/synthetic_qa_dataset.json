Introduction Text generation is a crucial task in natural language process- ing, which aims to produce ﬂuent and coherent texts for var- ious applications. Previous text generation methods mainly relied on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Pawade et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2016a; Qi et al., 2021), which generate texts sequentially from left to right. How- ever, RNNs suffer from issues such as long-term dependency and exposure bias",
